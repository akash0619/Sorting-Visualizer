  <div>Merge sort</div>
  <div>run time: O(n lg n)</div>
  <div>Disadvantage:1. constant factor is high, slow when size is small</div>
  <div>
    Disadvantage:2. does not work in place, keep complete copies of the entire
    input array

    Divive: find the middle index by adding start and end, take the floor of
    division by 2{" "}

  <div>
    Conquer: recursively sort through first half, recursively sort through
    second half
  </div>
  <div>Merge the answer from first half and second half</div>
